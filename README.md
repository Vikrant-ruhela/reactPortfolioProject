# My Portfolio Website - React Project

Welcome to my Portfolio Website repository! This project showcases my first React application, which serves as my personal portfolio website. I utilized various features and technologies within React to create an interactive and visually appealing portfolio.

## Features

My portfolio website demonstrates the following key features:

### 1. useState Hook for State Management

- The project incorporates the useState hook, a fundamental React hook, to manage component state. This allows for dynamic updates and rendering of different sections on the website.

### 2. React Routing

- To achieve smooth navigation and enable users to explore different sections of the portfolio, I used React Router. This allows for a single-page application experience, with multiple sections accessible through unique URLs.

### 3. React Components and Props

- The website is built using multiple React components, each encapsulating specific functionalities and features. I have made effective use of props to pass data between components and maintain a modular structure.

### 4. Framer Motion for Animations

- To enhance the user experience, I employed Framer Motion, a popular animation library for React. This brings life to the website by incorporating eye-catching animations and transitions.

## Project Setup

To set up and run this portfolio project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash

3. Install all the required dependencies by running the following command:
